\caption{Sources of uncertainty in $\beta$ (fraction of excess energy absorbed by the ocean), $\epsilon$ (expansion efficiency of heat), and $\Delta Z$ (thermosteric sea-level rise, relative to 1995--2014). \emph{Drift uncertainty} is derived from the 2nd--98th inter-percentile range, averaged across scenarios and models. For $\beta$ and $\epsilon$, drift uncertainty is calculated using both the trend method and the integrated-bias (``int.-bias'') method. \emph{Model uncertainty} is derived from the inter-model range, averaged across scenarios. \emph{Scenario uncertainty} is derived from the inter-scenario range, averaged across models. Model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty are relatively insensitive to the choice of drift correction method, so these sources of uncertainty are shown for the trend method only. When calculating uncertainty in $\beta$, $\epsilon$, $\Delta Z$ for the 2050s, and $\Delta Z$ for the 2090s, the four projection scenarios are used (but not the historical scenario). When calculating the uncertainty in $\Delta Z$ for the 1850s, the single historical scenario is used instead -- therefore, scenario uncertainty cannot be calculated for the 1850s. Further details are provided in Table S2.}
