\caption{CMIP6 ensemble median and range (minimum–maximum) for different sources of uncertainty. For each drift-correction method, \emph{drift uncertainty} is derived from the 2nd--98th inter-percentile range of the drift-corrected data. \emph{Model uncertainty} is derived from the inter-model range. \emph{Scenario uncertainty} is derived from the inter-scenario range. The ensemble statistics shown here correspond to the summary statistics shown in Tables~S2--S6. For further details, see Tables~S2--S6.}
