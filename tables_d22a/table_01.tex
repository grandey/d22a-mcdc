\caption{Sources of uncertainty in $\beta$ (fraction of excess energy absorbed by the ocean), $\epsilon$ (expansion efficiency of heat), and ${\Delta}Z$ (thermosteric sea-level rise, relative to 1995--2014), for the CMIP6 ensemble. \emph{Drift uncertainty} is derived from the 2nd--98th inter-percentile range of the drift-corrected data. \emph{Scenario uncertainty} is derived from the inter-scenario range. \emph{Model uncertainty} is derived from the inter-model range. For $\beta$ and $\epsilon$, drift uncertainty is calculated using both trend-method MCDC and integrated-bias-method MCDC. Scenario uncertainty and model uncertainty are relatively insensitive to the choice of drift correction method, so these sources of uncertainty are shown for trend-method MCDC only. When calculating the uncertainty in $\beta$, $\epsilon$, and ${\Delta}Z$ for future decades, the four projection scenarios are used (but not the historical scenario). When calculating the uncertainty in ${\Delta}Z$ for the 1850s, the single historical scenario is used instead, hence scenario uncertainty cannot be calculated for the 1850s. Expanded results -- showing the uncertainties for different models and scenarios -- are provided in Table~S2. The expanded results (Table~S2) have been averaged across models and scenarios to produce Table~1.}
